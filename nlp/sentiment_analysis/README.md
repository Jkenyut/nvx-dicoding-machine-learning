## Techniques

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Uses `TF-IDF` and `Cosine Similarity` to recommend books based on authors and titles.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Employs `Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)` and `Alternating Least Squares (ALS)` to provide user-based recommendations.

## Details

- **Dataset**: "goodbooks-10k" from Kaggle.
