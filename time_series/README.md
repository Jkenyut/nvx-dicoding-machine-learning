## Details

- **Model**: An `LSTM` (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network is used to predict future power consumption.
- **Dataset**: The "Household Power Consumption" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, available on Kaggle.
- **Features**: The model uses multiple features, including global active power, reactive power, voltage, and sub-metering data.
