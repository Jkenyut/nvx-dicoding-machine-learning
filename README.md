## Projects Overview

This repository contains a diverse set of machine learning projects, each located in its own directory with detailed documentation and code. Below is a summary of the projects:

| Project Domain                       | Description                                                                                                                                            | Technologies                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| üó£Ô∏è **Natural Language Processing**   | Two projects: (1) A text classification model to categorize student questions, and (2) A sentiment analysis model for product reviews.                 | `TensorFlow`, `scikit-learn`, `NLTK`, `Sastrawi` |
| üìö **Recommendation Systems**        | A book recommendation system implementing **Content-Based Filtering** (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity) and **Collaborative Filtering** (SVD, ALS).          | `scikit-learn`, `Surprise`, `Pandas`             |
| üñºÔ∏è **Image Classification (TFLite)** | An animal image classification model using transfer learning with the `Xception` architecture, converted to **TensorFlow Lite** for mobile deployment. | `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `TFLite`                  |
| üìà **Time Series Forecasting**       | A forecasting model predicting household power consumption using an **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) network.                                         | `TensorFlow`, `scikit-learn`, `Pandas`           |

Each project includes a comprehensive README within its directory, detailing the problem statement, methodology, results, and evaluation metrics.

## Technologies Used

This repository leverages a robust set of Python libraries and frameworks to build and deploy machine learning models:

- **Core Libraries**:
  - `Pandas` for data manipulation
  - `NumPy` for numerical computations
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for data visualization
- **Machine Learning**:
  - `scikit-learn` for traditional ML algorithms
  - `Surprise` for recommendation systems
- **Deep Learning**:
  - `TensorFlow` and `Keras` for neural network development
  - `TensorFlow Lite` for model optimization and deployment
- **Natural Language Processing**:
  - `NLTK` for text processing
  - `Sastrawi` for Indonesian language stemming
- **Code Quality**:
  - `Black` for consistent code formatting
  - `Flake8` for linting and style enforcement

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the projects locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher (download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **pip**: Python package manager
- A modern IDE or text editor (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jkenyut/nvx-dicoding-machine-learning.git
   cd nvx-dicoding-machine-learning
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install core dependencies:**
   Each project may require specific libraries, but you can install the core dependencies for all projects:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow sastrawi scikit-surprise
   ```

4. **Install additional project-specific dependencies:**
   Refer to the `requirements.txt` file in each project directory (if available) or the project's README for specific dependencies. For example:
   ```bash
   pip install -r recommendation_system/requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

Each project is self-contained in its own directory. To run a specific project:

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd recommendation_system
   ```

2. Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   python dicoding_satria_nur_saputro_recommendation.py
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook dicoding_satria_nur_saputro_recommendation.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the instructions in the project-specific README for additional setup, such as downloading datasets or configuring environment variables.

Example for the Time Series Forecasting project:

```bash
cd time_series
python dicoding_satria_nur_saputro_time_series.py
```
